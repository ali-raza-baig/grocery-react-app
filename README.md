# Grocery Website Frontend

This project is a frontend for a grocery website, developed using Vite and React. It includes several pages such as the Home page, About page, Login page, and Contact page, all styled using Tailwind CSS with components from Tailblock and Flowbite. The project follows a modular structure where components are created first, followed by layouts, and then integrated into pages. React Router DOM is used for navigation between different pages.

## Project Structure

- **Components**: Reusable UI components built using Tailwind CSS, Tailblock, and Flowbite.
- **Layouts**: Layouts define the structure of each page, arranging the components in a cohesive manner.
- **Pages**: Individual pages of the website, each corresponding to a different route in the application.
- **Routing**: Managed using React Router DOM, allowing for smooth navigation between pages.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: A fast and lightweight build tool for modern web development.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Tailblock**: A collection of ready-to-use Tailwind CSS blocks.
- **Flowbite**: A library of pre-built components using Tailwind CSS.
- **React Router DOM**: A library for routing in React applications.

## Pages Overview

- **Home Page**: The landing page that showcases featured products and promotions.
- **About Page**: Provides information about the grocery business.
- **Login Page**: A user authentication page for logging into the website.
- **Contact Page**: A page where users can reach out to the business for inquiries or support.

## Project Workflow

1. **Component Creation**: Build individual UI components using Tailwind CSS, Tailblock, and Flowbite.
2. **Layout Design**: Assemble components into layouts that define the structure of each page.
3. **Page Development**: Integrate layouts into pages, using React Router DOM for routing.
